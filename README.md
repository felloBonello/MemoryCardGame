# MemoryCardGame
A graphical version of the card game 'Memory' (aka Concentration). Users take turns flipping two cards and trying to make a match. If a match is made they gain a point and get to go again. This game can handle 2-4 players. This game implements a service contract and a service host. Once one player has started the service host project other players can connect to the hosts IP address and play together remotely.
